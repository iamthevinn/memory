# Notes
- There's basically nothing in the App Level
- Create a class for Board/Tiles.
    - This will create an empty array of tile objects
    - gameStuats and tiles are only two stateful properties
    - two children, Tile and Footer
    - updateBoardState, userClicked, randomizeArray, gameStart, getTileColor
